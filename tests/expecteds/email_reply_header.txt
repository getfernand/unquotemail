This is the latest reply.

The thread contains two previous replies, and the most recent reply header has a line break in it.

If we don't patch the line break, the reply header ends up in THIS fragment, instead of in the quoted fragment.

On the one hand, there could be a line in the reply starting with the word 'On.'

On the other hand, it could happen TWICE!
