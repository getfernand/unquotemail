Hi Katharine.  Sounds great.  Are there and dietry restrictions or things your husband does/doesn't like to eat?  Would you like to do a few hors d oeuvres and then a 3 or 4 course dinner?  Let me know what you think will work best and I will start working on a menu and proposal.  Thanks so much and look forward to hearing from you soon.
